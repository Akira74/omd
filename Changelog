0.52     Dec 22 2011
          - Switch Check_MK to version 1.1.12p6 (Please refer to the migration notes
            of Check_MK on http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_migration_notes.html!)
          - FIX: WATO - Fixed permissions on conf.d directory for shared apache mode
          - FIX: Fixed permissions for PHP temp files in shared mode
          - Get rid of dummy host in a plain fresh OMD site
          - NagVis
            - Updated to NagVis 1.6.1
              Note #1: The userfiles directory has been moved from var/nagvis/userfiles
              to local/share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles. The side individual files
              shal be copied during update. The old files are left untouched in the
              old directory. If everything works as expeced after update and you
              don't plan to downgrade again you can savely remove the directory
              var/nagvis/userfiles from your site
              Note #2: During "omd update" omd might tell you that the file etc/nagvis/auth.db
              is obsolete and you changed its contents. In normal cases you want to keep the
              file (press k) to keep your user accounts, role assignments and permissions.
            - local/ hierarchie can now handle .php files
            - Moved nagvis-omd.ini.php to new conf.d/ directory
          - OMD
            - Added 'umount' option to unmount the ramdisk of a site
            - Added 'TMPFS' config option to be able to run omd without the tmpfs filesystem
            - Handling comments and empty lines in .info files correcty 
            - Made 'setversion' work on broken links
            - New commands 'disable' and 'enable'. OMD does not depend on the
              home directories of disabled sites. This is useful in cluster environments.
            - New option 'omd create --disabled' and 'omd init' which allows the creation
              of a site with an empty home directory and afterwards population it. Again
              this supports cluster environments.
            - start, restart and reload now honor the option -f,--force: All
              sites will then be affected, regardless of AUTOSTART
            - FIX: omd update: page diff through less -F -X (-X is new). This fixes
              a problem where the diff is not visible on dumb terminals like PuTTY.
            - FIX: omd: site processes where missing supplementary groups when starting
              the site as root via 'omd start SITE'
            - FIX: omd update handled most files twice (without need). This is
              fixed now.
            - FIX: omd diff now correctly handles relative paths.
            - FIX: omd diff now correctly instantiates templates before showing
              diff in verboes mode
            - FIX: omd umount skips unmounting on partly running sites

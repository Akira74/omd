Jmx4Perl Agent
==============

This directory contains the most popular jmx4perl agent, the agent
used for JEE application servers. It is packaged as a Web Archive
(WAR) file and can be deployed as any other JEE web application within
a so called servlet container (tomcat, jetty, jboss, weblogic,
websphere, ...). E.g. for Tomcat, copy the provided agent into
$TOMCAT/webapps and it the can be accessed typically via an URL like
http://localhost:8080/j4p 

For more information about available agents (OSGi, Mule, generic
JDK6), please consult www.jmx4perl.org

0001:
    Extend the configuration file nagios.cfg with files in nagios.d: After
    reading the main configuration file, Nagios removes ".cfg" from the name
    of the file (if the file ends in .cfg) and adds ".d". Then it reads in
    all files in that directory ending with ".cfg" (non-recursive). The order
    is not specified.

0002:
    The file include/utils.inc.php includes config.inc.php by going up 
    one directory in the physical directory tree. This patch changes that
    behaviour in a way needed for OMD: It is including the site specific
    config file /omd/sites/###SITE###/etc/ngaios/config.inc.php. The site name
    is extracted from the script file name (supplied by Apache).

0003:
    The web frontend checks the original home page for updates. The check
    may be makes sense for folks who installed nagios by themselfs, but
    not within a distribution. This patch removes the update check from
    main.php

0004:
    When loading a broker module, Nagios makes a temporary copy of the
    module file, loads that with dl_open, and deletes it afterwards.
    This shall save agains modifications caused by a user overwriting
    the module with 'cp'. This patch removes that behaviour and loads
    the module in the traditional way. This prevents problems with tmpfs
    mounted as non-root (where Nagios places the module copy).

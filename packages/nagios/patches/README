0001:
    Extend the configuration file nagios.cfg with files in nagios.d: After
    reading the main configuration file, Nagios removes ".cfg" from the name
    of the file (if the file ends in .cfg) and adds ".d". Then it reads in
    all files in that directory ending with ".cfg" (non-recursive). The order
    is not specified.

0002:
    The file include/utils.inc.php includes config.inc.php by going up 
    one directory in the physical directory tree. This patch changes that
    behaviour in a way needed for OMD: It is including the site specific
    config file /omd/sites/@SITE@/etc/ngaios/config.inc.php. The site name
    is extracted from the script file name (supplied by Apache).

Index of patches

0001:
    Extend the configuration file nagios.cfg with files in nagios.d: After
    reading the main configuration file, Nagios removes ".cfg" from the name
    of the file (if the file ends in .cfg) and adds ".d". Then it reads in
    all files in that directory ending with ".cfg" (non-recursive). The order
    is not specified.

0002:
    The file include/utils.inc.php includes config.inc.php by going up 
    one directory in the physical directory tree. This patch changes that
    behaviour in a way needed for OMD: It is including the site specific
    config file /omd/sites/###SITE###/etc/ngaios/config.inc.php. The site name
    is extracted from the script file name (supplied by Apache).

0003:
    The web frontend checks the original home page for updates. The check
    may be makes sense for folks who installed nagios by themselfs, but
    not within a distribution. This patch removes the update check from
    main.php

0004:
    When loading a broker module, Nagios makes a temporary copy of the
    module file, loads that with dl_open, and deletes it afterwards.
    This shall save agains modifications caused by a user overwriting
    the module with 'cp'. This patch removes that behaviour and loads
    the module in the traditional way. This prevents problems with tmpfs
    mounted as non-root (where Nagios places the module copy).

0005:
    Reverts patch which breaks deactivation of active checks. 

0006:
    Adds OMD related config options and macros to the init script.

0007:
    The init script is showing full '-v' output on config error.

0008:
    When the Nagios process terminates for some reason and the lock-file
    which contains the pid is not cleaned up the init script throws an
    error message when executing 'etc/init.d/nagios stop'.
    With this path the init script checks if the process is stil alive
    before trying to kill it.

0009:
    When someone executes the init script with the stop action and the
		pid file can not be found it is a good sign that nagios is not running
		anymore. So don't terminate the script with exit code 1. Using exit
		code 0 insted.

0010:
    This patches fixed the problem to jump back to the start page
    whenever you press F5.

0011:
    This patches removes a useless loop in the status summary page.

0012:
    The patch merges the configuration files from nagios.d dir to nagios.cfg.
    in the init script of nagios.

0013:
    This patch ensures a good OMD environment for the init script

0004:
    Prepend /omd/versions/X/lib/python to Python path

0005:
    Handle the case during stopping of Apache where SIGTERM is
    received while Python is currently running. Normally mod_python
    will be caught be the signal and end in a deadlock. The patch
    ignores the signal until the Python interpreter has exited and
    simply exit the process afterwards.

0006:
    Stop using the deprecated md5 module. Use hashlib instead.
    This prevents a deprecation warning exception visible in apache
    error log.
    Patch: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&id=526062

0007:
    Prevents a deprecation warning:

    lib/python/mod_python/util.py:119: DeprecationWarning: object.__init__() takes no parameters
    str.__init__(self, value)

    After my tests & searches the str.__init__(self, value) is useless and
    can simply be commented out.

The other patches are taken with thanks from the FEDORA mod_python
package and fix compile problems and RedHat 6.1 (and probably
other distros as well).

0004:
    Prepend /omd/versions/X/lib/python to Python path

0005:
    Handle the case during stopping of Apache where SIGTERM is
    received while Python is currently running. Normally mod_python
    will be caught be the signal and end in a deadlock. The patch
    ignores the signal until the Python interpreter has exited and
    simply exit the process afterwards.

The other patches are taken with thanks from the FEDORA mod_python
package and fix compile problems and RedHat 6.1 (and probably
other distros as well).

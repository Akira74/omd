In this directory you can put your own custom scripts which extend the startstop-scripts in etc/init.d

The init-hook-scripts are executed by the init-scripts before or after a certain operation. This is defined by following a naming scheme. 

<name of the init-script>-<name of the operation>-<pre or post>

Example:
nagios-reload-pre will be executed when you run "etc/init.d/nagios reload" or "omd reload nagios" just before the actual reload.


Real-live use case:
Imagine your etc/nagios/conf.d/myconfig is the clone of a git repository. Whenever you reload Nagios, the init-hook-script will do a 
cd etc/nagios/conf.d/myconfig
git pull
and update the config files from the central repository. Then the actual reload follows.

Currently only the following scripts can be used, all others are ignored:
nagios-*-pre
shinken-*-pre
icinga-*-pre
apache-*-pre
